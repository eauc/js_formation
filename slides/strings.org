  UTF characters:
  #+BEGIN_SRC js :exports results :results output :session basic-types
  "☮ world".length;
  "☮ world"[0];
  "☮ world".charCodeAt(0);
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  - strings are UTF16 internally
  - but most of the time get converted to UTF8 during IOs
  - most of the time UTF characters count as one character
  - and Node's sources are expected to be UTF8
  #+END_NOTES

  ES6 templates:
  #+BEGIN_SRC js :exports results :results output :session basic-types
  var myVar = "world";
  `Hello, ${myVar}`;
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC js :exports results :results output :session basic-types
  var myObject = {a: 1};
  `myObject=${myObject}`;
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC js :exports results :results output :session basic-types
  `myObject=${JSON.stringify(myObject)}`;
